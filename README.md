# Head First Design Patterns 2nd edition

I created this repo to help me work through the book Head First Design Patterns 2nd Edition.
I will use this README as a notebook/logbook type of thing.
For each chapter I will make a section where I list stuff that I found interesting, wanted to remember or just was funny.

## 1. Intro to Design Patterns

In this chapter, I was introduced to my first design pattern.
And why one wants to use design patterns.

- You spend way more time in the code after the application is live
- Scalability

The main example of this chapter is about a duck simulator.
The designer is asked to make ducks fly and implements this in the `Duck` class.
However, this also made all the rubber ducks fly around.
To combat this, he created 'Duck Behavior' interfaces.
This Design Pattern in called the **Strategic Design Pattern**.

> In java, you can create interfaces. 
> In python this is not really a thing. 
> You can make your class behave as such by using the `ABCMeta` and `@abstractclass` packages

You can find the code of the duck simulator in the `1_intro_to_design_patterns` folder.

What are you doing?! You aren't even done with chapter 1 yet...

Please finish this first before you continue.
